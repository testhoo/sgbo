											<strong></strong> Investor Jeff Bezos is widely known for his love of numbers. And so it turned out that when he was asked to make a one-time donation of 50 million dollars, he eagerly agreed to it. In addition to this, he also gave a huge bonus (which he regularly paid out). In the end, the amount of his "wishlist" was quite modest.But you can start earning money on your investment — in any amount.For beginners, this is a very good opportunity to start investing your money.If you have a large amount of money, then it makes sense to start with small amounts, monthly averaging. For example, if your "wishlist" is: how to provide your family with a stable income in the event of an unexpected force majeure;how to create a passive income that will fully support your family in an emergency;how to invest and multiply money. All these parameters are the very basics of investing money.But even with these basics, you can make a lot of money. For example, I'll give you a very simple example: start investing 10-20% of each of your income (say, a salary or a part of your income). Each of these 10-20% will eventually turn into your business. this is assuming that you have the appropriate amount of time and competent investments). Consider also that you can make any number of investments, which can be purchased with money earned on your own investment. 4) a Strong "B" on the stock market This word is probably on your lips right now. It means that the stock market is extremely strong (over a long time horizon).That is why in the short term, you should not buy stocks, because it is possible that the market will decline significantly. an unexpected force majeure;buy when they are down, and sell when they are up. 5) Keep your money in the stock market It is this simple: buy when they are cheap, and sell when they are expensive. This also applies to currency exchange rates. 1) Read my article " Where NOT to invest money? TOP 3 most dangerous places for money". 2) Read my article " what skills do you need to become a professional?" rich."
