											<strong></strong> It seems to us that rich people are endowed with certain special skills, unique talents, which allow them to get rich through their hard work and regular investment. But is it true? In this article, we will talk about how to establish your "relationship" with money, gain prosperity and material benefits. well-being.To begin with, I want to introduce you to one of your new financial literacy skills. This is a skill that will allow you to quickly establish your "relationship" with money and get rich. self-realization:1) the Test of your "wishlist" With money, you must pass a series of tests. You will have to earn more, spend less time at work, raise your salary.You will have to increase your earnings. You will have to do all this in order to form a "financial cushion" and start investing. 2) Test — see if you can pass a test It's a symbolic test. But the main thing is that you have to meet the requirements set by the Cult of poverty, which is:you must refrain from making impulsive, "lazy" purchases;you must limit your expenses to your income;you must make a commitment to yourself that when you go to the store, you will not spend money on "wishful thinking". economic programs";you must make your own " financial cushion" and regular investments.3) Success = set of correct stepsThe goal is to get to a certain income level. However, not everyone is able to do this. But you will succeed if you take the time to set aside short-term problems, optimize your expenses, and learn how to handle your money competently.This is where the cult of poverty "cults" and destroys talent.PRACTICE. Get rid of financial problems, find prosperity and material rewards.First, decide if you want to get rid of your ever-empty wallet. If you really, really want to get something in this life, then go ahead. But if you just decide that you will get by, then it's time to stop "pushing" money away from you and start "attracting" it.Time for a little fun. Try to find yourself a small part-time job — and start investing there. 4) Plan large expenses in advance and gradually increase your income. Money should work. To do this, have a stash — put aside 10-20% of each of your income (or any other amount). 5) Learn to "make friends" with money. To do this, you should have a "financial cushion" and an anchor, ideally a well-established investment.PRACTICE. Get rid of money problems:1) Plan large
